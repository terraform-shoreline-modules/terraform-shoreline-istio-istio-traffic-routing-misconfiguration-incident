### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Istio Traffic Routing Misconfiguration Incident

This incident type involves a misconfiguration in the Istio traffic routing. Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides a way to connect, manage, and secure microservices. A misconfiguration in the Istio traffic routing can cause issues with the routing of traffic between microservices, leading to service disruptions, outages, and performance degradation. The misconfiguration can occur due to human error, incorrect configuration settings, or misaligned policies. Identifying and resolving this incident requires analyzing the Istio configuration, identifying the misconfiguration, and taking corrective actions.

### Parameters

```shell
export NAMESPACE="PLACEHOLDER"
export POD_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
export WORKLOAD_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
export SERVICE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
export ORIGINAL_ROUTE="PLACEHOLDER"
export NEW_ROUTE="PLACEHOLDER"
export GATEWAY="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check if Istio is installed

```shell
istioctl version
```

### Check if the Istio control plane is healthy

```shell
kubectl -n istio-system get pods
```

### Check the configuration of the Istio ingress gateway

```shell
kubectl -n istio-system describe service istio-ingressgateway
```

### Check the Istio VirtualServices and DestinationRules

```shell
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get virtualservices
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get destinationrules
```

### Check the Kubernetes Services and Endpoints

```shell
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get services
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get endpoints
```

### Check the Kubernetes Ingress resource, if used

```shell
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} describe ingress
```

### Check the logs of the Istio sidecar containers

```shell
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} logs ${POD_NAME} -c istio-proxy
```

## Repair

### Check the Istio traffic routing configuration for any errors or inconsistencies. Verify that the routing rules are correctly defined and applied to the relevant services and workloads.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Get the Istio traffic routing configuration
istioctl get virtualservices -n ${NAMESPACE} > virtualservices.yaml

# Check for errors or inconsistencies in the configuration
if grep -q "error" virtualservices.yaml; then
    echo "ERROR: Istio traffic routing configuration contains errors"
    exit 1
fi

# Verify that the routing rules are correctly defined and applied to the relevant services and workloads
if ! grep -q "${SERVICE_NAME}" virtualservices.yaml || ! grep -q "${WORKLOAD_NAME}" virtualservices.yaml; then
    echo "ERROR: Istio traffic routing configuration is missing relevant services or workloads"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Update the traffic routing rules to correct any misconfigurations. This may involve modifying the routing rules, updating the service definitions, or changing the networking configuration.

```shell
bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the variables
ISTIO_NAMESPACE=${NAMESPACE}
ISTIO_GATEWAY=${GATEWAY}
ISTIO_VIRTUAL_SERVICE=${SERVICE_NAME}
ORIGINAL_ROUTE=${ORIGINAL_ROUTE}
NEW_ROUTE=${NEW_ROUTE}

# Update the Istio Virtual Service with the corrected route
kubectl patch virtualservice $ISTIO_VIRTUAL_SERVICE -n $ISTIO_NAMESPACE --type=json -p="[{\"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/spec/gateways/0\", \"value\": \"$ISTIO_GATEWAY\"}, {\"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/spec/hosts/0\", \"value\": \"$ORIGINAL_ROUTE\"}, {\"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/spec/http/0/route/0/destination/host\", \"value\": \"$NEW_ROUTE\"}]"

echo "Istio Virtual Service updated successfully with corrected route"
```
